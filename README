This is a mini search engine project that I did as part of Database Management System Design Course.

Given a query string to search for, this application will look for all the documents in a TREC-9 file
and rank them based on their Binary Frequency Count. As a pre-processing step first I created an Inverted
Index of all the keywords in the documents using Porters algorithm. What Porter's algorithm does is it
strips all words and come out with only the root word. Inverted indices will be created based on these
root words.

When the user enters a word in the search bar and hits SEARCH button, all the documents 
containing that word will be displayed. These documents will be ranked according to the frequency of occurence 
of that word.

If the user enters more than one word then the frequncies will be multiplied and the document having
the highest multiplied frequency count will be ranked higher.

A working demo of this app can be found at this link- http://people.cs.clemson.edu/~sourimd/CPSC862/Ass8/

I have used PHP, HTML and JavaScript to write this app.
